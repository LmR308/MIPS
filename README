Computer Architecture Experiment
This project achieved Institution encode and decode based on MIPS32 manual.
It implements the mutual conversion between assembly instructions and binary encoding.
Note:
We specify that the assembly instruction format follows the assembly representation definition.
eg.add $s1,$t0,$s4 or add $17,$8,$20.
hexToInst.js is used to generate test data for binary encoding and corresponding assembly instruction representations through the MIPS32 binary and assembly instruction converter on the webpage[The link is as follows:http://mipsconverter.com/instruction.html].
