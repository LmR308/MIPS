# Computer Architecture Experiment
## Project background
This project achieved Institution encode and decode based on MIPS32 manual.  
It implements the mutual conversion between assembly instructions and binary encoding.  
## Project File Function Description
The ***get_table.py*** is used to Crawling MIPS Opcode Reference information from web pages[http://mipsconverter.com/opcodes.html] to generate ***table_data.xlsx***.  
The ***hexToInst.js*** is used to generate test data for binary encoding and corresponding assembly instruction representations through the MIPS32 binary and assembly instruction converter on the webpage[http://mipsconverter.com/instruction.html] and generate ***test_data.txt*** for tesing.  
The ***MIPS_manunal.xlsx*** is generated by Adobe ACrboat's PDF extraction function, which extracts the table information of MIPS IV Architecture from ***mips isa.pdf*** into Excel.  
## Note:  
We specify that the assembly instruction format follows the assembly representation definition.  
eg.add $s1,$t0,$s4 or add $17,$8,$20.
